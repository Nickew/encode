# Encode Web App

Provides simple responsive interface to encrypt and decrypt your text data with
symmetric and asymmetric (RSA) algorithms.

Encode App uses Node.JS Crypto lib on back-end.

It is just a practice project to improve my experince with development tools, in
a future I will remove back-end implementation and do encryption stuff on a
front-end.

##### Tools:

- React 16.8
- React-Router v5
- Node.js/Express
