# Encode Web App

Provides simple responsive interface to encrypt and decrypt your text data with
symmetric and asymmetric (RSA) algorithms.

Encode App uses nodejs crypto lib on back-end, it means your text data sends to
back-end in non-crypted form. **Not recommended to use this app for encrypting
important data.**

It is just a practice project to improve my experince with development tools, in
a future I will remove back-end implementation and do encryption stuff on a
front-end.

##### Tools:
